It is a special type of distribution that accepts two positional arguments:</p> <ol> <li>hazard: <code>\u03bb</code></li> <li>cumulative hazard <code>\u039b</code></li> </ol> <p>Start with the <code>01-single_tte.jl</code> file. Showcase the <code>tte_single</code> dataset. Focus on explaining the evid <code>3</code> at time <code>0</code> for all subjects. This is a reset event code and it is used in time to event data to notify when the model needs to account for the hazard. If a subject has not experienced the event until the observed time frame (right censoring), then no more observations would be added for that subject. However, if there is an event, then an evid <code>0</code> would be recorded at the observed time with <code>1</code> as the <code>DV</code> value. We also have a binary covariate <code>DOSE</code> that impacts in the propensity of subjects experiencing an event. Since we are using evids, we need also to specify an amount when parsing the data with <code>read_pumas</code>. However, we don't have an amount column in the <code>tte_single</code> dataset. We need to create a column <code>:AMT</code> filled with <code>0</code>s. That solves the amount issue. Our population is ready to be used in the subsequent models.</p> <p>We will use three models in the single time to event workflow. They have the same covariate (<code>DOSE</code>) but they differ on the assumptions of the underlying distribution of the hazard function:</p> <ol> <li>Exponential hazard function: assumes constant hazard</li> <li>Weibull hazard function: assumes either increasing, decreasing or constant hazard</li> <li>Gompertz hazard function: assumes either increasing, decreasing or constant hazard</li> </ol> <p>The exponential model is the first TTE model that we will fit. We are defining <code>\u03bb\u2081</code> as the basal hazard and <code>\u03b2</code> as the <code>DOSE</code> covariate effect. In the <code>@pre</code> block we calculate <code>_\u03bb\u2081</code> as the basal hazard with inter-subject variability and <code>_\u03bb\u2080</code> as the total hazard for each subject. Since the exponential model has a simple formula, we define the in the <code>@vars</code> block that <code>\u03bb = _\u03bb\u2080</code>.</p> <p>For the Weibull model the parameters are almost the same as the exponential model, but with the addition of the shape parameter <code>\u039a</code>. In the <code>@vars</code> block we use the Weibull formula for the hazard function <code>\u03bb</code>. The Gompertz model follows a similar pattern as the Weibull model.</p> <p>In all of these three models, we are using the special distribution <code>TimeToEvent</code>. For the fitting procedure we cannot use <code>FOCE()</code> and we need to use either <code>NaivePooled()</code> or <code>LaplaceI()</code>.</p> <p>Finally, you can compare the estimates with the <code>compare_estimates</code> from <code>PumasUtilities</code>. If you find it opportune, you can go over model comparisons between the three models with fit metrics, e.g. AIC, goodness of fit plots, and visual predictive checks. However, be mindful that model assessment is not a requirement for this workshop.</p>"},{"location":"instructors/#get-in-touch","title":"Get in touch","text":"<p>If you have any suggestions or want to get in touch with our education team, please send an email to training@pumas.ai.</p>"},{"location":"instructors/#license","title":"License","text":"<p>This content is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"reference/","title":"Reference Sheets for Pumas-AI Time to Event Workshop","text":""},{"location":"reference/#key-points","title":"Key Points","text":"<ul> <li>You can define time to event models in Pumas by using the <code>TimeToEvent</code> function in the <code>@derived</code> block</li> <li>You can use any parameterized function to define the underlying distribution of the hazard function</li> <li>Time to event models in Pumas need to be fitted using either <code>NaivePooled</code> or <code>LaplaceI</code> and do not support <code>FOCE</code></li> </ul>"},{"location":"reference/#summary-of-basic-commands","title":"Summary of Basic Commands","text":"Action Command Observations Define a time to event model <code>TimeToEvent(\u03bb, \u039b)</code> <code>TimeToEvent</code> should be used in the <code>@derived</code> block, <code>\u03bb</code> and <code>\u039b</code> are hazard and cumulative hazard respectively."},{"location":"reference/#glossary","title":"Glossary","text":"Time to event model <p>Umbrella class of statistical methods for which the outcome variable of interest is time. We are interested in the time until an event occurs.</p> Hazard <p>Instantaneous rate at which an event of interest occurs at a given point in time. It represents the risk or probability of experiencing the event within a very small time interval, given that the individual has survived up to that point. The basal hazard refers to the baseline hazard rate or the hazard rate in the absence of any covariates or explanatory variables. The total hazard, also known as the conditional hazard or the hazard function, takes into account both the basal hazard and the effects of covariates. The cumulative hazard function represents the cumulative probability of experiencing the event of interest up to a given time t. It is obtained by integrating the hazard function over time.</p> Weibull distribution <p>Commonly used probability distribution to describe the distribution of event times. It is a flexible distribution that allows for a wide range of hazard shapes, including increasing, decreasing, or constant hazard rates over time.</p> Gompertz distribution <p>The Gompertz distribution is another probability distribution commonly used in survival analysis and time to event modeling.
